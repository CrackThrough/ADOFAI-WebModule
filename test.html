    If you are getting an error such as below one, you should use a host
    instead. <br /><br />

    Error: Access to script at '...' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS
    policy: Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http,
    data, chrome, chrome-extension, chrome-untrusted, https.<br /><br />

    How to create a host by yourself using npm:<br />
    1. If you do not have node.js, install node.js.<br />
    2. Just in case, update your npm, npx, nodejs and everything related to
    it.<br />
    3. If you do not have http-server module, install it by doing:<br />
    <b>$ npm i -g http-server</b><br />
    4. If you do have http-server module, type the command:<br />
    <b>$ npx http-server -c-1</b><br />
    5. Open your web browser and go to localhost:8080. Done!<br />
